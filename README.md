# SuperStore KPI Dashboard

This interactive dashboard is built using **Streamlit** and **Plotly** to provide key performance insights into a retail business. It aggregates data from an Excel file ("Sample - Superstore-1.xlsx") and presents it in a modern, dark-themed interface thatâ€™s both visually appealing and highly responsive.

## Key Features

- **Interactive Filters:**  
  Users can refine the data view by selecting multiple regions, states, categories, and sub-categories along with a customizable date range. This allows for tailored, in-depth exploration of the dataset.

- **Dynamic KPIs:**  
  The dashboard displays top-level metrics like **Sales**, **Quantity Sold**, **Profit**, **Margin Rate**, and **Average Discount** in eye-catching tiles. Each tile includes hover tooltips that provide additional context, ensuring users get detailed insights at a glance.

- **Enhanced Time-Series Visualization:**  
  Daily data is resampled into monthly aggregates, and a 3-month rolling average is added to an area chart. This approach reduces noise and highlights longer-term trends, making it easier to analyze overall performance.

- **Product & Regional Analysis:**  
  A bar chart ranks the top 10 products based on the selected KPI, while another chart shows **Sales by Region**. These visualizations help quickly identify high-performing products and regions.

- **Data Accessibility:**  
  The dashboard includes a CSV download option and an embedded, scrollable data table, enabling users to further analyze or share the filtered data offline.

## Overview

This repository showcases the transformation of a text-heavy report into an agile, interactive tool designed for quick, data-driven decision-making.
